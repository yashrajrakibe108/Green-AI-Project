ðŸ“Œ Overview
This case study is part of a practical training session introducing Green AI, Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) concepts with an emphasis on energy-efficient and sustainable AI development in healthcare. The project aligns with UN Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3): Good Health and Well-being.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
Understand fundamentals of Green AI and its importance.

Learn basic ML and DL techniques using real-world healthcare data.

Train predictive models for health outcomes (heart disease).

Visualize performance and promote ethical AI practices.

ðŸ—‚ Dataset
Dataset Name: Heart Disease Dataset
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
Size: 303 records Ã— 14 features
Features:

Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type (cp), Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps), Cholesterol (chol), Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs), etc.

Target: 1 (Heart Disease Present), 0 (No Heart Disease)

ðŸ§ª Methodology
Data Preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Scaling

Model Training

Performance Evaluation

Models Used:
Logistic Regression (Baseline model)

Random Forest Classifier (Ensemble method)

Neural Network using TensorFlow/Keras (Energy-conscious design)

ðŸ“Š Accuracy
Achieved an accuracy of 85â€“87% across models.

âœ… Conclusion
Demonstrated practical use of AI in healthcare.

Emphasized low-power, ethical AI modeling.

Successfully predicted heart disease with standard and DL approaches.

ðŸ”® Future Scope
Introduce energy-efficient model pruning.

Expand to multi-class health datasets.

Integrate Explainable AI (XAI).

Explore CNNs for medical image analysis.
