ðŸ“Œ Overview
This case study is part of a training session focused on introducing Green AI, Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) with an emphasis on sustainable and health-focused AI development. It supports UN SDG 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.

ðŸŽ¯ Key Objectives
Understand Green AI and energy-efficient modeling principles.

Learn ML and DL basics using real-world health datasets.

Train predictive models to evaluate health outcomes.

Visualize model performance and promote ethical AI.

ðŸ—‚ Dataset Description
Dataset: Heart Disease UCI Dataset
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
Size: 303 rows Ã— 14 columns
Features: Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type (cp), Resting BP (trestbps), Cholesterol (chol), Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs), Rest ECG, Max Heart Rate (thalach), Exercise Angina (exang), etc.
Target: 1 (Heart Disease) or 0 (No Disease)

ðŸ§ª Approach and Methodology
Steps Followed:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Scaling

Model Training with ML Algorithms

Evaluation using Accuracy and Loss Graphs

Algorithms Used:

Logistic Regression: Simple and interpretable baseline model

Random Forest Classifier: Robust ensemble method

Neural Network (Keras/TensorFlow): Lightweight DL model using Green AI techniques (fewer epochs and neurons)

ðŸ“Š Results
Accuracy: 85â€“87%

RÂ² Score: -0.810

âœ… Conclusion
This project showcased how AI and ML can be applied to healthcare using energy-conscious methods. The models provided reliable predictions while maintaining low resource consumption and ethical standards.
